                        I graduated with a Mechanical Engineering (Honours) degree in 2019 and during my studies I was 
                        able to get an internship at HeliMods. After completing my studies I gained entry into the Brisbane City Council Gradute program
                        as a Graduate Mechanical Engineer. During my time at Council I was able to work in the Transport for Brisbane and Brisbane Infrastruture division.
                        I was fortunate enough to have managed a varity of small-medium risk projects as a graduate. After 2-years, I am now looking for a new challenge, and 
                        pivoting from eningeering into Technology, Software and Data Science. For me it is a natural evolution as the core foundation is still problem solving. 
                        Currently, I am studying Software Engineering through Academy Xi powered by Flatiron School. I am a motivated self-started, a great communicator and 
                        have a thrist to learn new things.
